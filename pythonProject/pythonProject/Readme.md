Virtual Pet Actions
The virtual pet has the following actions that can be triggered by user interaction:

Idle Behavior: The pet performs random idle animations.
Clicking: When the user left-clicks on the pet, it responds with a clicking animation.
Rest Reminders: The pet periodically displays rest reminder animations to prompt the user to take a break.
Movement: The pet can move left and right on the screen.
Music Playback: The pet can play music when prompted by the user.
Restaurant Recommendations: The pet can provide restaurant recommendations.
Weather Query: The pet can query weather information.
Chinese-English Translation: The pet can perform Chinese-English translation.
Notes
Ensure that you have a stable internet connection to enable weather querying and Chinese-English translation functionality.
Modify the file paths in the code according to your actual setup to ensure the correct loading of background images and dialogue files.
